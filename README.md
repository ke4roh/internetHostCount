internetHostCount
=================

This is a collected count of hosts on the internet, from http://ftp.isc.org/www/survey/reports/current/ and https://web.archive.org/web/20010330090639/http://www.isc.org/ds/host-count-history.html

Contributions are welcome, to both extend the count backward in time and to keep it current.  

To generate the graphs from the supplied data, ensure that gnuplot is installed and on the path, then run "make all".  It will create a "target" directory with svg and png versions.
