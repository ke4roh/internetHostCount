internetHostCount
=================

This is a collected count of hosts on the internet, from http://ftp.isc.org/www/survey/reports/current/ and https://web.archive.org/web/20010330090639/http://www.isc.org/ds/host-count-history.html

Contributions are welcome, to both extend the count backward in time and to keep it current.  If you wish to present the data in another format (SVG or whatever), I would like to figure out a way to use the same data as input for all the outputs.  I am not married to Open Office for generating the charts - it was particularly easy.
